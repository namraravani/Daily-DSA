# Daily DSA Diary

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Diary** repository! Here, I commit to uploading 1-2 pieces of code every day, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository serves as a personal log of my progress and a resource for anyone interested in learning and improving their DSA skills.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to practice and enhance my understanding of various data structures and algorithms. Each day, I solve at least one or two problems and upload the solutions here. The problems range from beginner to advanced levels and cover a wide array of topics including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

## Daily Updates
I will update this section with the problems solved each day. Each problem will be placed in its respective folder based on the topic it covers.
